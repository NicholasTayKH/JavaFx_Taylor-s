Hi! How can I assist you today with your profile or bookings? Here’s a quick overview of what you can do:

1. **Profile Management**:
   - You can update your personal information (like name, email, phone).
   - Check your current booking and either cancel or edit it.
   - View a read-only list of your booking history.

2. **Booking Services**:
   - Create new bookings using our calendar picker and select your desired time slot.
   - Confirm your booking easily with the 'Book Now' button.

3. **Chatbot Commands**:
   - If you want to **show your profile**, just type "Show my profile."
   - To **book an appointment**, you can say "I want to book."
   - For managing bookings, you can use commands like "Cancel my last booking" or "Update the date for my upcoming booking."

If you have specific requests or questions, feel free to ask!
